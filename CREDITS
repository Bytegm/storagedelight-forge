The Storage Delight mod is built upon the foundation of the Farmer's Delight' cabinet block.
This mod expands upon this concept, introducing a variety of cabinet textures to enhance the gameplay experience.

All cabinet textures are the artistic creations of vectorwing and are a valuable contribution to the Farmer's Delight mod.
I extend my gratitude for the exceptional work and dedication in bringing these textures to life.
Additionally, it's important to note that all Drawers, Glass Cabinets, and the Cherry Cabinet in the Storage Delight mod were
implemented using the codebase from the Farmer's Delight (Fabric) cabinet block by Zifiv & vectorwing.
